# The Plain-English Guide to SECR Compliance for UK SMEs (2026 Update)

Let me save you some time.

If you've landed here, you've probably seen "SECR" mentioned in a tender, heard it from your accountant, or spotted it in a competitor's annual report—and you're wondering: *Does this actually apply to me? And if so, what do I actually have to do?*

Good news: **Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)** isn't as complicated as it looks. The problem is that most guidance is written by lawyers, for lawyers.

This guide is different. I'll explain SECR the way I'd explain it to a business owner—no jargon, no waffle, just the stuff that actually matters for your 2026 compliance.

## First, the honest answer: Why should you care about SECR?

Here's what I won't do: pretend carbon reporting is exciting.
Here's what I will do: tell you why it's becoming a massive competitive advantage.

Three things are happening at once:

1. **Your customers are asking.** Large companies now have their own carbon reporting obligations. To hit their targets, they need data from their supply chain—which means you. If you can't provide credible numbers quickly, you're a procurement risk.
2. **Banks and insurers are paying attention.** Climate risk is moving into underwriting decisions. Lenders want to know you understand your energy exposure. *"We don't really track that"* is becoming a very expensive answer.
3. **The FRC is watching.** The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) oversees these disclosures. "Greenwashing" now includes making climate claims you can't back up with data in your annual report.

**The bottom line:** Even if SECR doesn't legally apply to you today, the capability to produce trustworthy carbon data is becoming a requirement to do business with the "big players."

## Does SECR actually apply to my business?

SECR applies to "large" UK companies, SMEs, and LLPs. You are typically in scope if you hit **at least two of these three** thresholds in your financial year:

| Threshold | Number |
| --- | --- |
| **Employees** | 250 or more |
| **Turnover** | £36 million or more |
| **Balance Sheet** | £18 million or more |

*Note: If you're part of a group structure, the rules can get sticky. Always check with your accountant if you're hovering near these limits.*

### The "Low Energy User" Exemption

If your total UK energy consumption is **40 MWh or less** per year, you qualify as a "low energy user." You can skip the detailed reporting, but you **still must state** in your report that you are a low energy user. You can't just stay silent.

## What you actually have to report (in plain English)

SECR boils down to four key areas:

### 1. Scope 1: The stuff you burn

Emissions from fuel you burn directly in things you own or control.

* **Examples:** Gas for heating your warehouse, diesel in company-owned vans, or petrol in company cars.

### 2. Scope 2: The electricity you buy

Emissions from the electricity you purchase from the grid to power your operations.

* **Examples:** Office lighting, warehouse machinery, and charging company EVs.

### 3. Scope 3: The "Grey Fleet" (Mandatory)

This is where many SMEs get tripped up. Under SECR, you **must** report emissions from business travel in rental cars or employee-owned vehicles where the company pays for the fuel/mileage.

* **Example:** A sales rep driving their personal car to a client meeting and claiming 45p per mile.

### 4. Intensity Ratio & Narrative

* **Intensity Ratio:** You must compare your emissions to a business metric (e.g., *Tonnes of CO₂e per £1m revenue*). This shows if you're actually getting more efficient as you grow.
* **Efficiency Narrative:** A description of what you did this year to save energy (e.g., "Switched to LED lighting") and what you plan to do next.

## Where SMEs usually get stuck (and how to avoid it)

The maths isn't the hard part; the **data chase** is what causes the panic.

Typically, electricity bills are in the Finance inbox, gas bills are with Facilities, and fleet data is on a random spreadsheet in Operations. When the annual report deadline looms, someone has to play "detective" to find it all.

**The fix:**

1. **Assign an Owner:** One person needs the authority to chase data across departments.
2. **Monthly Data Drops:** Don't wait for year-end. Get utility bills and fuel receipts into one place every month.
3. **Audit Trails:** Use a system where every number can be traced back to an original bill. If a regulator asks "how did you get this?", you need to answer in seconds, not days.

---

## Why spreadsheets break (and what to do instead)

Spreadsheets are fine for a start, but they eventually lead to "version chaos" and broken formulas. A proper carbon intelligence platform like **Wulo** solves this by:

* **Automating Calculations:** Using the latest government-recognised emission factors automatically.
* **Direct Integrations:** Pulling data straight from utility providers so you don't have to chase PDFs.
* **Audit-Ready Reports:** Generating the exact table you need to drop into your annual report.

## Looking Ahead: UK SRS is here

You'll start hearing more about **UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS)**. These are the new UK-endorsed versions of the global ISSB standards.

**The 2026 Reality:** The UK government is currently phasing these in to replace the old SECR framework for the largest companies. While most SMEs aren't the primary target yet, your bank and your biggest customers *are*. By getting your SECR data right today, you are "future-proofing" your business for the SRS transition.

## Your SECR Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] **Check the thresholds:** Do you hit 2 of 3? (250 staff / £36m turnover / £18m balance sheet)
- [ ] **Estimate energy use:** Are you above 40 MWh? (If you have a warehouse or fleet, the answer is usually yes).
- [ ] **Gather "Grey Fleet" data:** Collect mileage claims from the last 12 months.
- [ ] **Pick an intensity metric:** "Tonnes CO₂e per £1m revenue" is the gold standard for SMEs.
- [ ] **Draft your narrative:** Write down 3 things you did this year to be more efficient.
