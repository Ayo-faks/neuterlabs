## Overview

Pacific Logistics Network faced a classic sustainability challenge: major customers were demanding verifiable emissions reductions, but the company feared that decarbonization would increase costs and slow delivery times in their competitive market.

Their existing approach to transportation emissions relied on industry-standard emission factors applied to fuel purchases—a method that provided annual totals but no actionable insights for optimization. With transportation representing 98% of their carbon footprint, they needed granular visibility and real-time optimization capabilities.

## The Transportation Emissions Challenge

Logistics companies face unique decarbonization challenges:

- **Dynamic optimization**: Routes change daily based on customer demand, traffic, weather, and vehicle availability
- **Trade-off complexity**: Faster routes often consume more fuel; consolidation improves efficiency but may extend delivery times
- **Measurement difficulty**: Emission factors vary by vehicle age, load weight, terrain, driving style, and fuel type
- **Customer expectations**: Delivery speed and reliability cannot be compromised for sustainability goals
- **Driver buy-in**: Route optimizations only work if drivers actually follow them

## Our Approach

We implemented WULO's transportation intelligence module across their entire fleet in a 4-month phased rollout:

### Telematics Integration
We connected WULO to their existing fleet telematics systems (GPS, fuel sensors, engine diagnostics), creating real-time carbon tracking at the vehicle and route level. This revealed significant variations in emissions intensity even for similar routes.

### AI-Powered Route Optimization
Our ML models learned from millions of historical trips to identify optimal routes that minimize carbon intensity while respecting delivery time windows. The system considers:

- Real-time traffic conditions and predicted congestion
- Elevation profiles and terrain characteristics
- Vehicle-specific fuel efficiency curves under different loads
- Weather impacts on fuel consumption
- Dynamic load consolidation opportunities

### Driver Engagement Platform
We developed a mobile app that gamifies emissions reduction, showing drivers their carbon performance and rewarding efficient driving behaviors. This created cultural change that amplified the impact of route optimization.

### Customer Carbon Reporting
WULO automatically generates shipment-level carbon footprint reports for customers, differentiating Pacific Logistics in competitive bids and enabling customers to meet their own Scope 3 reporting requirements.

## Results

The impact exceeded expectations across all dimensions:

**Carbon Performance**: Fleet emissions intensity dropped from 847g CO2/ton-km to 610g CO2/ton-km, a 28% improvement that positioned them as the lowest-carbon option in their regional market.

**Operational Efficiency**: Optimized routes and load consolidation reduced total miles driven by 15%, cutting fuel costs by \$3.2M annually. Average delivery times actually improved by 12% due to better traffic avoidance.

**Driver Engagement**: The gamified driver app achieved 94% adoption. Drivers reported enjoying the system, and turnover rates decreased by 18%—an unexpected but significant benefit in a tight labor market.

**Competitive Advantage**: Three major customers expanded their contracts specifically citing verified low-carbon logistics. The company won six competitive bids where carbon performance was a deciding factor.

**Modal Shift Opportunities**: WULO's analysis identified 120 lane-pairs where rail intermodal would reduce emissions by 65% with minimal cost or time impact. Pacific Logistics is now piloting an intermodal offering.

## Industry Recognition

Pacific Logistics Network was named "Logistics Provider of the Year" by the Sustainable Transportation Association, with judges citing their systematic approach to carbon intelligence as a model for the industry.

The company has since joined the SmartWay Transport Partnership and published their methodology, encouraging industry-wide adoption of carbon intelligence approaches to freight decarbonization.

Their success demonstrates that transportation emissions reduction and operational efficiency are not trade-offs but complementary goals when approached with sophisticated carbon intelligence platforms.
